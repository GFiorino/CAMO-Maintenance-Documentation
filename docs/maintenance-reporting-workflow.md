# Maintenance Reporting Workflow

## Overview

Ongoing maintenance reporting is essential for tracking aircraft condition, scheduling tasks, and supporting audits. As a CAMO Technical Administrator, your role includes collecting data, updating records, and generating clear maintenance status reports.

This guide outlines the standard maintenance reporting workflow used in CAMO environments.

---

## Daily Data Entry

After each flight day:
- Log **flight hours** and **cycles** from the journey/tech log
- Record any **defects or discrepancies**
  - Mark as rectified or deferred (under MEL)
- Update **tracking system** with completed maintenance or inspections

---

## Monthly Reports

At the end of each month, CAMOs typically generate a **Continuing Airworthiness Status Report** covering:

### Key Components:
- Fleet utilization (hours/cycles per aircraft)
- Completed maintenance events (A-checks, replacements)
- Upcoming due items (tasks, ADs, calendar-based inspections)
- Deferred defects and MEL items
- ARC status overview

---

### Example: Monthly Maintenance Snapshot

| Aircraft | Hours Flown | Last Check | Next Due      | Deferred Items |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 9H-ABC   | 78 hrs       | A-Check on 15-Jan | 6Y Check â€“ Mar 2025 | Galley Oven INOP (MEL) |
| 9H-DEF   | 82 hrs       | Weekly Check 27-Jan | AD 2021-0105R1 â€“ May 2025 | None |

## Forecast & Look-Ahead

Create a **30â€“90 day forecast** showing:
- Expiring ARCs
- Major checks due
- AD deadlines
- LLP replacements

Used by:
- Maintenance Planning
- Fleet Managers
- Quality / Compliance teams

---

## Communication Flow

- Reports are shared with:
  - CAMO management
  - Maintenance provider
  - Operators (as needed)
  - Lessors (upon request)
- Typically via PDF or internal portal
- Some CAMOs use dashboards or spreadsheets exported from systems like AMOS or OASES

## Key Responsibilities

âœ… Ensure accuracy of flight hours/cycles  
âœ… Double-check due dates before publishing  
âœ… Maintain backup of all reports (for audits)
