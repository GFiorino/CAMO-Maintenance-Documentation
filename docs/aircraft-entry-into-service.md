# AMP Update Procedure

## Overview

The **Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP)** defines all mandatory and recommended maintenance tasks required to keep an aircraft airworthy. Over time, the AMP must be updated due to regulatory changes, manufacturer revisions, or in-service experience.

This document outlines how a CAMO Technical Administrator supports AMP updates in compliance with **EASA Part-M** and **Part-CAMO** regulations.

---

## Why AMP Updates Are Needed

AMP changes are triggered by:
- **Manufacturer revisions** (e.g., updated Maintenance Planning Document)
- **New Airworthiness Directives (ADs)**
- **Operational changes** (e.g., usage in harsher environments)
- **Regulatory changes** or authority findings
- **Corrective actions** after audits or ARC reviews

---

## AMP Update Workflow

### 1. Identify the Change

- Example triggers:
  - New AD requiring repetitive inspections
  - OEM increases lubrication interval from 500FH to 600FH

---

### 2. Analyze Impact

- Engineering team reviews safety implications
- Checks if task overlaps with existing AMP content
- Confirms whether the change is **mandatory** or **optional**

---

### 3. Determine Approval Path

Under **EASA Part-CAMO**, AMP changes follow two paths:

| Type of Change           | Approval Required |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Major (e.g. new AD)      | Direct authority approval |
| Minor (e.g. task interval tweak) | Indirect approval (if CAMO has privilege) |

---

### 4. Draft the Revision

Update the AMP document:
- Add, remove, or revise affected task(s)
- Update revision log:
```yaml
Rev 3 – Added engine oil check at 400FH (OEM SB 79-001), interval change on task 32-11-02
```

### 5. Review and Approve

- Internal review by Continuing Airworthiness Manager or Quality Manager
- Submit to authority if required, or process under indirect approval per CAME procedure

---

### 6. Implementation

- Inform Maintenance Planning and update task scheduling
- Notify maintenance provider if new tasks apply
- Upload revised AMP to document control system
- Archive previous AMP revision properly

---

### 7. Example: AMP Revision Log

| Revision | Date       | Summary                                              | Approval Type     |
|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Rev 3    | 2025-03-10 | Added 400FH oil check; extended flap lube to 600FH   | Indirect (QA)     |
| Rev 2    | 2024-08-22 | Initial AMP for A320 MSN12345                        | Direct (CAA)      |

---

## Key Takeaways

- All AMP changes must be traceable and approved according to EASA rules.
- Documentation must include revision history, reason for change, and effective date.
- The CAMO Technical Administrator supports the process by updating files, coordinating data entry, and ensuring clear communication with planners and maintenance staff.

> ✈️ Proper AMP control ensures continued safety and compliance — a cornerstone of CAMO operations.
