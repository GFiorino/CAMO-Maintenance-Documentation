# Airworthiness Directive (AD) Input

## Overview

**Airworthiness Directives (ADs)** are legally binding requirements issued by aviation authorities to address unsafe conditions in aircraft or components. CAMOs are responsible for tracking, scheduling, and documenting compliance with ADs.

This document outlines the process a CAMO Technical Administrator follows to manage AD input and ensure full regulatory compliance.

## What Is an Airworthiness Directive?

An **AD** mandates:
- A specific inspection, replacement, or modification
- A strict timeline (e.g., “within 100 FH or 3 months”)
- Ongoing compliance (if repetitive)

Authorities that issue ADs include:
- **EASA** (Europe)
- **FAA** (United States)
- State of Design of the aircraft/component

---

## AD Management Workflow

### 1. Monitor AD Sources

- Subscribe to EASA bi-weekly AD updates
- Review manufacturer bulletins and lessor communications
- Track revisions (e.g., AD 2021-0105 → 2021-0105R1)

---

### 2. Evaluate Applicability

- Check aircraft type, serial number, engine/APU configuration
- Review modification or SB embodiment status
- Determine if the AD applies or can be marked **Not Applicable**

---

### 3. Create AD Record

Log into the Maintenance Tracking System and create an entry:

| Field               | Example                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| AD Number           | EASA 2023-0250                    |
| Subject             | Fuel Pump Wiring Inspection       |
| Applicability       | A320 with MSN 12345               |
| Compliance Deadline | 30-Jun-2025 or 500 FH             |
| Status              | OPEN                              |

---

### 4. Plan Compliance

- Coordinate with Maintenance Planning
- Include AD task in next suitable maintenance check
- Order parts, kits, or SB instructions as required

---

### 5. Perform & Record

After completion:
- Update the AD record with:
  - Date of compliance
  - Hours/cycles at compliance
  - Work order or CRS reference
- Mark the AD as **COMPLIED** or **CLOSED**

---

### 6. Sample AD Status Table

| AD No.       | Title                          | Due Date    | Status    | Last Action               |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 2023-0250    | Fuel Pump Wiring Inspection    | 30-Jun-2025 | OPEN      | Scheduled for next check |
| 2021-0105R1  | Wing Spar Cap Inspection       | 01-May-2025 | NEXT DUE  | Last done: 01-May-2023   |
| 2019-0227    | Ram Air Inlet Modification     | N/A         | N/A       | Not applicable            |

---

## Key Points

- All applicable ADs must be tracked and visible at all times
- Supporting evidence (e.g., SB, Form 1, CRS) must be stored
- CAMO staff must use the **latest revision** of any AD

> 🛠️ AD compliance is non-negotiable — it directly affects airworthiness and safety.
