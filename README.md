# CAMO Maintenance Documentation Guide

## Overview

This project is a technical documentation sample created for aviation professionals, recruiters, and hiring managers interested in evaluating my ability to produce accurate, structured, and industry-relevant documentation in the context of Continuing Airworthiness Management Organizations (CAMO).

The content reflects the tasks of a **CAMO Technical Administrator**, based on EASA Part-M and Part-CAMO standards. It is designed to simulate real-world internal documentation used in business aviation, commercial airlines, or MROs.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Demonstrate my ability to create documentation that supports airworthiness compliance, maintenance program management, and technical reporting workflows.
- Show practical understanding of aviation maintenance data tracking, regulatory context (EASA), and internal CAMO procedures.
- Provide an example of structured documentation using Markdown, suitable for both internal use and technical documentation portfolios.
- Showcase ability to prepare practical CAMO administrative documents using Microsoft Office tools (Word and Excel).

## Mock-Up CAMO Office Documents

To demonstrate practical understanding of CAMO administrative workflows, the following sample documents are included:

- [CAMO Maintenance Compliance Summary (Word Document)](Mockup-Documentations/CAMO%20Maintenance%20Compliance%20Summary.docx)
- [Maintenance Task Tracker (Excel Spreadsheet)](Mockup-Documentations/Maintenance_Task_Tracker.xlsx)

These mock-ups simulate real-world tasks such as maintenance tracking, compliance monitoring, and airworthiness documentation management.

---

## Audience

This guide is written for:

- CAMO teams (especially Technical Administrators and Records Staff)
- Technical writers entering the aviation industry
- Aviation companies evaluating writing and documentation skills for compliance support roles

---

## How to Navigate

1. Start from [`index.md`](index.md) or go directly into the `/docs` folder.
2. Each file focuses on one real-world responsibility of a CAMO Technical Administrator.
3. Visuals are stored in the `/images` directory and referenced inside the Markdown content where relevant.
4. Practical Word and Excel mock-up documents are available in the `/Mockup-Documentations` folder.

This project is structured for clarity and modularity â€” each doc stands on its own while forming part of a complete guide.
